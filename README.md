## Design Process

### Wireframing or Sketching
I'm not very confident in design, so this layout was based on my imagination with the help of AI tools for guidance and ideas.

### Color Scheme and Font Choices
Same as above â€” I relied on AI and basic defaults, keeping things clean and minimal.

### Responsiveness Strategy
I used Tailwind CSS to handle responsiveness by applying utility classes like `sm:`, `md:`, and `lg:`. Tailwind makes it easy to adapt layouts for different screen sizes.

### Animation Approach
I used Framer Motion to add smooth, minimal animations for transitions and hover effects. It integrates well with React and makes animations simple to manage.

### Libraries or Frameworks Used
- **Tailwind CSS**: for fast and utility-first styling.
- **Framer Motion**: for clean and modern animations.
- **Lucide React**: for using consistent and customizable icons.
